# Todo-App-Django
A very basic Todo Application in Django rest framework and vue.js
I am using postgresql. If you want to use any other database, you can change the confirguration in settings.py, else you just need to change the details of your database with mine.
Also you will need to install psycog2 package if you are using postgresql. Use ---> pip install pyscog2
Don't forget to install rest framework. Its already included in Installed Apps in settings.py
